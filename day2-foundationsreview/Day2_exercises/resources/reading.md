Python is an enormous language. It's a daunting task just to be aware of everything that's in its standard libraries, much less to know how to use all of it. Python 3 module of the week is a great resource:

The Git Book is a free book maintained by the developers of git. There's a lot in it that is beyond the scope of what you'll need as a working programmer, but I consider chapters 3, 4, 6, and A3 to be must-reads.

There is a free online textbook called "Think Python" that takes a very functional programming approach to teaching the language.

It can be a useful read. Make sure you read the 2nd edition, the 1st edition is in python2.

Another useful online textbook is Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. It is very practical applications focused. It's my favorite free written resource for beginning python programmers.

If you want to spend some money on books that go beyond the basics, *Fluent Python* and *The Python Cookbook* are both excellent. Fluent Python does a very deep dive on the real intricacies of the language. The Python Cookbook is a big collection of example solutions to practical problems that shows off a whole lot of the standard library.

If you join the ACM (the software engineer's professional association) and pay your dues, you will have access to Safari Bookshelf, which gives you ebook access to just about every coding book on the commercial market. It's quite the resource.
